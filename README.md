# Askme-bot
I created a bot that has access to different tools, such as weather, current news, and local storage (including bank statements). The bot can choose which tool to use to answer a question. Additionally, it can analyze bank statements to find the maximum or minimum money spent, as well as money spent on a specific day.

##### How to run bot
`python
grdio main.py
